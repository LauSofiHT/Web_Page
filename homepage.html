    <h1>Berries</h1>
    <p>A berry is a small, pulpy, and often edible fruit. Typically, berries are juicy, rounded, brightly colored,
        sweet, sour or tart, and do not have a stone or pit although many pips or seeds may be present.‍[1] Common
        examples of berries in the culinary sense are strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, white
        currants, blackcurrants, and redcurrants.‍[2] In Britain, soft fruit is a horticultural term for such fruits.‍

    <h2>Strawberries</h2>
    <p>The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid plant cultivated
        worldwide for its fruit. The genus Fragaria, the strawberries, is in the rose family, Rosaceae. The fruit is
        appreciated for its aroma, bright red colour, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is eaten either fresh or in
        prepared foods such as jam, ice cream, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavourings and aromas are widely
        used in commercial products. Botanically, the strawberry is not a berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit. Each
        apparent 'seed' on the outside of the strawberry is actually an achene, a botanical fruit with a seed inside it.
