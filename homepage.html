        <h1>Berries</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>A berry is a small, pulpy, and often edible fruit. Typically, berries are juicy, rounded, brightly colored,
            sweet, sour or tart, and do not have a stone or pit although many pips or seeds may be
            present.‍<sup>[1]</sup>
            Common
            examples of berries in the culinary sense are strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, white
            currants, blackcurrants, and redcurrants.‍<sup>[2]</sup> In Britain, soft fruit is a horticultural term for
            such
            fruits.‍
        </p>
        <h2>Strawberries</h2>
        <p>The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) <sup>[1]</sup> is a widely grown hybrid
            plant
            cultivated
            worldwide for its fruit. The genus Fragaria, the strawberries, is in the rose family, Rosaceae. The fruit is
            appreciated for its aroma, bright red colour, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is eaten either fresh or in
            prepared foods such as jam, ice cream, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavourings and aromas are
            widely
            used in commercial products. Botanically, the strawberry is not a berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit.
            Each
            apparent 'seed' on the outside of the strawberry is actually an achene, a botanical fruit with a seed inside
            it.

            <h2>Blueberries</h2>
            <p>Blueberry refers a wild section of purple or blue berries.<br> It grows in a type of woody plant called a
                shrub.<br> Many
                types of blueberries grow in North America and eastern Asia.<br> Blueberries are more common between May
                and
                October<br>.[source?]

                Blueberry has a sweet taste, with a little acidic hint.<br> Wild blueberries have a stronger taste.<br>
                Blueberries are
                good for making jelly, jam, pie, muffins, pancakes, and many other foods.<br>The most widely cultivated
                species
                of
                blueberry is Vaccinium corymbosum.<br> Some similar kinds of berries are called blueberry or huckleberry
                in
                different places.<br></p>
